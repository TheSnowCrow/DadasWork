# ✨ Magic Typing!

An interactive typing game that teaches letters through beautiful visualizations and touch tracing. Perfect for kids learning to type and trace letters!

My son always wants to 'help' with Dada's Work and type on the computer.  I had the idea of making a more fun screen for him to type on and this game was born!  He also is tracing letters at preschool so I had the idea to add that to a mobile version.  He loves it!  I hope your kids enjoy too!

## Contributions Welcome!

If anyone wants a fun little project create a new visualization to go in the background!  Send us a PR - We'd love it!

## 🎮 What is this?

**Magic Typing** is a playful, educational typing experience that turns keyboard practice into a magical adventure. My kid always wants to "help" with Dada's work on the computer - so I built this! Now they can type away while enjoying mesmerizing animations.

### Two Modes:
- **Desktop**: Challenge mode where you type the letters shown on screen (both uppercase and lowercase!)
- **Mobile**: Trace letters with your finger to learn letter shapes

Every keystroke or trace creates colorful particle effects and energizes one of 10 stunning visualizations!
