# Dada's Work: Magic Typing

A colorful, interactive typing visualizer for kids. Type anything and watch the screen come alive with beautiful animations!

My son always wants to 'help' with Dada's Work and type on the computer.  I had the idea of making a more fun screen for him to type on and this game was born!  He also is tracing letters at preschool so I had the idea to add that to a mobile version.  He loves it!  I hope your kids enjoy too!

## Contributions Welcome!
